# INI_Parser
Simple C++ class for parsing INI files

I wrote this because I was bored. It's possible I had no idea what I was doing. This hasn't had much testing.

If Wikipedia is correct about the format of these files (I didn't check it until
 after I wrote this, because I'm lazy), this has a few [somewhat serious issues](https://github.com/Zelda64fan/INI_Parser/issues) that I'll
 fix eventually.
